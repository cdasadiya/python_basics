## About This Repository

This repository is designed for a 16-year-old student with no programming background. Every topic is explained in simple English and placed in its own Python file so learners can run one concept at a time.

### What makes this course beginner friendly?

- Chapter-wise structure from basics to intermediate topics
- One topic per file
- Every Python file runs independently
- Detailed comments inside examples
- Expected output shown in each file header
- Common mistakes, interview questions, and best practices included
- No large projects; only focused topic-based programs
- Third-party examples include helpful install messages if packages are missing

2. Check Python version:

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is designed for learners who are new to programming, including young students starting from scratch. Each topic is explained with simple examples, practical comments, expected output, common mistakes, interview questions, and best practices.

### ✨ Why this course is beginner friendly

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   macOS/Linux:

---

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

5. Install required packages:

Programming means writing step-by-step instructions that a computer can follow. Think of it like a recipe: a recipe tells a person how to cook, while a program tells a computer how to calculate, decide, repeat, store, and display information.

## How to Run Programs

Run any file from the repository root:

```bash
python 01_introduction/03_first_program.py
```

Run another example:

```bash
python 05_loops/01_for_loop.py
```

For NumPy, pandas, and requests chapters, install dependencies first:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Verify the Repository

Compile every Python file:

```bash
python -m compileall -q .
```

Run all topic files one by one if you want a full local check. Third-party examples include beginner-safe dependency messages if a package is missing.

## Requirements

Third-party examples use these packages:

- `requests`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

Install them with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes for Learners

- Start from chapter 1 and move in order.
- Read the comments before running each file.
- Change values and run again to understand behavior.
- Do not skip mistakes; debugging is part of learning.
